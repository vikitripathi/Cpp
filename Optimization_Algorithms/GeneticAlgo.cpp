The goal of any optimization algorithm is to find a set of inputs that minimizes the cost function, so the
cost function has to return a value that represents how bad a solution is. There is no particular scale forbadness; 
the only requirement is that the function returns larger values for worse solutions
 */

Now as the cost function has been listed , goal is to min cost by choosing correct set of numbers

random searching and hill climbing can get stuck in local  minima
Genetics algorithms are way to avoid  getting struck in local minima and find the best overall minima ,called the
global minimum, which is what optimization algorithms are ultimately supposed to find.
